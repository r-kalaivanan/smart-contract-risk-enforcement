SC-GUARD - Cleaned Presentation Copy

This `cleaned/` folder contains a minimal, presentation-ready copy of the project
with only:

- `demo_presentation.py` (presentation script)
- `docs/FINAL_OUTPUT_EXAMPLE.md` (final output mockup)
- `test_contracts/ComplexVulnerable.sol` (test contract)

Use this folder for quick sharing or packaging. For full functionality, run the
scripts from the project root where the full `src/` modules and dependencies exist.
